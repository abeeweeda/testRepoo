I have more than 5 years of experience as data analyst in Infosys and General Electric,

getting requirements from the client to understanding and making reports.
I have good understanding of Python for data analysis and have hands-on experience in 
modelling in Pyhton.
I have experience from doing ETL to making reports to doing analysis.
In General Electric I was the first data person in my team of core engineers, I introduced 
the team to Business Intelligence Tools and how we can use them to get insight from the data.
I am capable to taking decisions and using tools/technologies based on needs and requirements.
I am a very quick learner and like exploring new tools and technology, 
As I have worked in many tools and programming language it's relatively easy for me to adapt to
new things, I have worked in Cognos, Tableau, Informatica, Javascript in the past and have 
understanding of Git and Docker.
I am very passionate about data and machine learning and how we can use them to get meaningful 
information
